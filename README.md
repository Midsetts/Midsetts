Hi, I'm Midsetts, and i'm an actively working FiveM developer.

I have been working with Multiple Frameworks, but mostly QBCore. 
I am looking to help out the community in the best way possible, and possibly fix any issues anyone might have. 

My main goal is to see everyone smile.

### My Background

I came from Atlanta , Georgia. I am a hard working person, dedicating around 60+ Hours a week to what i do. I am currently 22 years old, working with my brother. My brother is a clothing developer, and I usually work with scripts and things such. I have been into technology ever since i was 16. This happened because of how quickly my life was changing when both of my parents were killed in a car accident. I decided to do something that required a good amount of time to get my mind off of that. I started by playing games, and it was very helpful in my cause. I mainly played GTA 5. 

### How GTA Inspired me to do this?

GTA became one of my main games. I would play for hours a day, and then i would go pick up my girlfriend, and take her out somewhere. I've always tried my best to make people happy. About a year and a half ago to maybe about 2 years, i found FiveM. The glorious platform we like to roleplay on. I started by taking it slow. Slowly adding MLOs, clothing, tuning cars, adding cars, anything you can really think of, and then i started diving deeper. I began to find multiple opportunities for myself, and owning servers/developing for them. I have recently been trying to find more communities to take these opportunities, and so far i have been successful. I have owned multiple cities and worked with them for a while, growing my friendshps and connections. I have found that i work well with poeple.

### Why do i see myself as a good fit for any jobs? 

I, single handedly, have built multiple cities and communities from the ground up. These probably estimate around 6k+ in total. My recent city has been not as good, but that is because I lost around $4-5k recently. To be fair, I know I could be honorable and accountable in any situations. I want to be one of the guys people look up to and admire, as a level headed but yet friendly person. I handle things simply. I know where I stand as far as the community, and i want nothing more than to be people's homies unless immediate action is required. I am a very genuine guy and I would do almost anything to make sure people are enjoying themselves, and that is a definite on my part.
